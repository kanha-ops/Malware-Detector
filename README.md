# Malware-Detector
Malware Detector is a Python-based project designed to identify and classify various types of malware using advanced detection techniques. This tool aims to enhance cybersecurity by providing an efficient way to detect malicious software on systems and networks.

## Features

- Offline malware detection using local hash database.
- Online malware scanning using the VirusTotal API.
- User-friendly interface built with Tkinter.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `tkinter` library (usually included with Python)
- `hashlib` library (usually included with Python)

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install requests

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/malware-detector.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd malware-detector
    ```

3. Ensure you have the required libraries installed.

## Usage

1. Open the project directory and run the `malware_detector.py` file:

    ```bash
    python malware_detector.py
    ```

2. Use the interface to select a file for scanning. You can choose to scan the file offline using a local hash database or scan it online using the VirusTotal API.

## Configuration

- `hash_path`: Path to the local hash database file .
- `api_key`: Your VirusTotal API key for online scanning.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the Malware Detector:

1. Click the "Select" button to choose a file.
2. Click "Scan Offline" to scan the file using the local hash database.
3. Click "Scan Online" to scan the file using the VirusTotal API.
